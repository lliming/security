# Recommended instructions for DCC PIs during Epic 1

During October 2020, the CFDE portal is offering a preview of our description of your data holdings based on a C2M2 rendering of the data on your public portal. Access to this preview is restricted to authorized members of your team. Please use the following instructions to authorize members of your team to access the preview during October.

## Find your display name

Please visit the [CFDE portal](https://app.nih-cfde.org/) and click the "Log In" link in the upper right corner of the page.

The portal will offer a choice of organizations. We encourage you to use an organization you are already registered with, if possible. (Options include your university, eRA Commons, ORCID, etc.) You may also login using any Google ID or create a new Globus ID, but we recommend an identity you are already using.

Once you've logged in, your name will be displayed in the upper right corner, and clicking your name will pull down a menu. Select "My Profile" from this menu.

Once you've copied your display name, you may log out of the portal if you prefer, or just close the browser window.

## Collect your team's display names and send to CFDE

Now, ask your team members who will be reviewing your preview to do this and send you their display names.

When you have the display names for your team, send an email message to __________, listing the display names for your team, and noting which one belongs to you, the PI.  We'll take care of the rest!

If you need to add or remove any authorized viewers during the preview period, send us another email with the instructions and any related display names.

## Viewing your preview

When we receive your email, we'll reply letting you know your preview is ready. Return to the CFDE portal. If your name is displayed in the upper right corner, you are already logged in. If not, click the "Log In" button and login using the same organization as above.

Once you are logged in, your preview will be available for you to review.
